**Gerald Ford** never wanted to be President. In fact, that was the quality that helped him become President. Could Nixon's affable VP be an antidote to the cynical scheming of Nixon? His pleasant personality and complete lack of ambition was the antithesis of Nixon's poisonous plotting.

The shadow of Watergate was too long, and too dark to escape though. Particularly because Ford pardoned Nixon. The nation was not ready to forgive the former leader and did not take kindly to Ford doing so. Even though Ford felt he had to draw a line under Watergate, and was probably right.

In fact Ford did move on, and started to achieve a measure of success. For example, by 1976 the economy had begun to recover from the recession. Most importantly, it's generally accepted that he did start to restore faith in the office of the Presidency after the crippling damage done by Nixon. However, it was too little, too late; and before Ford really had a chance to build and implement his own program, he had to hand over to Jimmy Carter.

He confided to Al Haig after the election:

"Al, this is a very sad time for me. I never really wanted the job. And it was only in the last year or so that I realised that I could do it. And the tragedy is that when I really wanted it, I lost it."
