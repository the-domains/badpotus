LBJ had a goal to become president and ruthlessly and single-mindedly followed that goal. He adopted and believed in the goal very early.

Lyndon Johnson was 21 years old he just completed an enough credit at is University to be able to become a teacher. With the help of the President of the University, With whom he was close, he manage to get a job at Welhausen School

Lyndon Johnson was 21 years old, he just received enough credit from college to take a teaching position in a small school called... the students in the school were Mexican immigrants. They were treated very badly by the local population, in actual fact most people did not want to see a Mexican school. They believe that the Mexicans were only good for manual labour and that educating them with any given aspirations four things beyond their reach. In fact requirement was so negative towards these Mexican children that there were frequent murders of Mexicans either local population which were unreported, Or which no one was brought to justice for. Into this environment steps Lyndon Johnson, full of enthusiasm teach these children and not only that, to transform their lives.

The children admired the Lynden immensely. But being kids one of them was very good at imitating their teacher. And one day one of the children, Danny Garcia, entertained class with an impression of the tall gangly teacher with an awkward manner. Linda Johnson came in the room I was furious he held onto the boy and it's hard in front of the rest of the class the indicating him. And being disrespectful. He said to the boy quote don't you realise you're marking the future president of the United States" he was only 20 years old and yet he already had a certainty that his destiny was to be president of America. This is Lyndon Johnson LJ. Not only did that self-fulfilling prophecy come true he was the 36th president of United States, But he also did more than any other president before or since to help migrants in the situation that is school children stop is he didn't become president until he was in his 50s. What amazes me about this story is the confidence of the young Lyndon Johnson that would one day lead the most the most powerful nation on the earth.
