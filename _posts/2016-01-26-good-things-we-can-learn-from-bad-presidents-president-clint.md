description: "Good Things we can learn from Bad Presidents President Clinton gets help from Nixon On a cold Wednesday morning in March 1973, John W. Dean III, the Chief Legal Advisor to the President was talking with his boss about how to get hold of hush money. Like a scene from The Godfather, President Nixon said: “We could get that\_… you could get a million dollars. You could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten.” The leader of the free world was talking to his consigliere about how he could hide their criminal activity. Suffice it to say, this wasn’t a high point in the history of the US Presidency. Fast forward 20 years to 1993 and it was Nixon himself giving a President some advice.  Nixon told President Bill Clinton, who had been elected the previous year: “when asking for guidance from people who are more experienced than you, tell them what you plan to do first — and then ask for their reaction.” Advice on asking for advice. In fact, Nixon was a frequent source of advice to Clinton. Nixon proved to be a useful and accurate counsellor to the young President, particularly on the Soviet Union. We may have expected Clinton to turn to fellow Southern Baptist and Democrat Jimmy Carter, but not to Nixon, a Republican, and a scourge of liberals the world over. Even fellow Republican Barry Goldwater described him as “the most dishonest individual I ever met in my life.” And the thing is: It was good advice! For Bill Clinton a young President with very little foreign policy experience, who was dealing with the on-going collapse of the USSR, it was timely and useful counsel. Clinton got help where he could get it, and knew that Nixon, who had a number of foreign policy successes, was the right man. Ronald Reagan taught Clinton how to do a proper military salute. Nancy Gibbs describes how the two Presidents stood together, in Reagan’s LA office, perfecting Clinton’s salute. For that matter, Clinton also picked up some golf tips from Gerald Ford. Bill Clinton was not too partisan to learn from Republican Presidents, even from Richard Nixon, scourge of liberals the world-over and famous for Watergate. No matter how bad your worst president is, the chances are they did something right Who would you cite as the worst US President? Even if you’ve never been to America, you probably have an opinion on who is a ‘Bad President’. Perhaps Obama is on your list, or any of the presidents mentioned above: Clinton, Carter, Reagan, Ford or Nixon. But no matter how bad your worst president is, the one you love to hate, the chances are they did something right, and there’s something we can learn from them. Which is what this series is all about. Things I have personally learned from looking at the lives of ‘bad’ presidents. Watch this space and I will share with you some of the other things I have learned.
