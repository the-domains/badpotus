# Don't it Always Seem That Way?

Ford did not have an easy time picking up the Republican nomination. In many people's minds Reagan looked like he had a much more exciting and radical platform. Some felt that the fight against Reagan damaged him in the subsequent election battle with Carter. However, it was probably the battle with Reagan that helped Ford recognise that this was something he really wanted. Sadly, just as he realised he wanted the Presidency, he lost it.

Ford seemed initially to be an antidote to the cynical scheming of Nixon? His pleasant personality and complete lack of ambition was the antithesis of Nixon's poisonous plotting. "I have not campaigned either for the presidency or the vice presidency" he told the nation in his inaugural address; "I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it."

However, the shadow of Watergate was too long, and too dark to escape. The real blow to any of Ford's ambitions to actually win his office was self-inflicted: he pardoned Nixon. The nation was not ready to forgive the former leader and did not take kindly to Ford doing so. It seemed to underline the suspicion that Government was corrupt. Ford felt he had to draw a line under Watergate, but he drew a line through his own reputation.

In fact Ford did move on, and started to achieve a measure of success. For example, by 1976 the economy had begun to recover from the recession. Most importantly, it's generally accepted that he did start to restore faith in the office of the Presidency after the crippling damage done by Nixon. However, it was too little, too late; and before Ford really had a chance to build and implement his own program, he had to hand over to Jimmy Carter.

He confided to Al Haig after the election:

"Al, this is a very sad time for me. I never really wanted the job. And it was only in the last year or so that I realised that I could do it. And the tragedy is that when I really wanted it, I lost it."
