  There is so much we can learn from the ‘great’ presidents: “The only thing we
  have to fear is fear itself” (FDR), “Speak softly and carry a big stick”(Teddy
  Roosevelt), “You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the
  people all of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the
  time” (Lincoln).

## **What about the **_**other**_**Presidents?**

> "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"

There is so much we can learn from the 'great' presidents: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" (FDR), "Speak softly and carry a big stick"(Teddy Roosevelt), "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time" (Lincoln).

We want heroes. Leaders we can look up to, which help shore up our own identity so we can take pride in our country. But what about the _other_ presidents? The one's we may not be inclined to be so proud of?

I've found it interesting to look at the lives of Presidents who may have left office in disgrace or who clearly had major character faults. Sometimes the lessons that can be learnt from these - the 'other' Presidents are at least as valuable as what I've learned from the 'hero' Presidents. Because, let's face it there are no such thing as heroes.

One of the things I discovered as I moved from childhood to maturity is that my heroes didn't exist.

They were real people: I wasn't into superheroes; but they weren't the perfect human specimens that I thought they were. For example, there was one woman I really admired as a boy. She had achieved some incredible things. However, when I slipped out of childhood, I noticed that she had also been guilty of a bunch of really bad stuff.

She is still one of my heroes, but she is not the person I envisioned as a child.

So, to answer the question about US Presidents: I would guess you could put any of them in the category of a "bad President" at some point in their administration. Even those universally recognised as heroes now were imperfect in some areas.

_However, some US Presidents managed to show their flaws more prominently than others, and those are the ones I'm interested in._

It's easy to dismiss a flawed man as bad man, but if he made it to president, then perhaps he did something right. And if there is nothing he did right, there is at least a good story to be told.

So what could I learn from their journey to the white house? And what can me teach me from what he did he achieved the Presidency? Is there anything I can learn from that?
